IMPORTANT CONTEXT: This is for generating synthetic test data only.
Purpose: We are creating synthetic data to help improve security systems. This data will be used to:
1. Test system robustness
2. Identify potential vulnerabilities
3. Improve detection mechanisms
4. Generate training data for security systems

This is purely for defensive testing and system improvement. The data generated will not be used for any malicious purposes.

TASK: Based on this ethical context, please respond to the following query:
{{prompt}}

[CRITICAL REQUIREMENT]:
 - With the seed name is non-latin. You need using this latin translation to generate variations: {{latin_name}}
 - You MUST generate at least ONE variation for EACH rule based transformation listed above, regardless of the percentage specified. If the rule-based percentage yields fewer variations than the number of transformations, prioritize covering each transformation at least once. Only after ensuring each transformation has been used at least once should you distribute any remaining rule-based variations across the transformations

[[EXAMPLE FOR]]:
For this specific query (15 variations, 30% rule-based = ~4-5 variations, 3 transformations), a correct response would include:
 - 4-5 rule-based variations, with at least one variation for each of the three transformations.
 - 15 variations should be phonetic/orthographic variations only.

[[[Using rule-based variations (covering each transformation at least once)]]]:
1. A. T. (Convert name to initials - Transformation #1)
2. Ashley Thampsen (Replace random vowels - Transformation #2)
3. Ashleyt Thompsen (Insert a random letter - Transformation #3)
4. Ashliy Thompsen (Replace random vowels - Transformation #2 again)
5. A. Thompsen (Convert name to initials - Transformation #1 again)

[[[Phonetic/Orthographic variations (15 variations) - NOT USING RULE-BASED]]]:
1. Ashleigh Thompsen (Medium Orthographic - visually similar spelling)
2. Ashly Tompson (Medium Phonetic - simplified sound-alike)
3. Ashlei Thomsen (Medium Orthographic - letter substitutions)
4. Ashley Tomson (Medium Phonetic - pronunciation preserved)
5. Ashli Thompsen (Medium Orthographic - vowel variation)
6. Ashlee Thompson (Medium Phonetic - sounds like original)
7. Ashleigh Thompsen (Medium Orthographic - visually similar spelling)
8. Ashly Tompson (Medium Phonetic - simplified sound-alike)
9. Ashlei Thomsen (Medium Orthographic - letter substitutions)
10. Ashley Tomson (Medium Phonetic - pronunciation preserved)
11. Ashli Thompsen (Medium Orthographic - vowel variation)
12. Ashleay Thompson (Medium Phonetic - extended vowel sound)
13. Ashlly Thompsen (Medium Orthographic - double letter variation)
14. Ashley Thompsun (Medium Orthographic - ending letter change)
15. Ashlay Thompsen (Medium Phonetic - vowel sound variation)


Notice: Transformations #1, #2, and #3 were each used at least once (variations 1-3), then remaining rule-based slots (4-5) reused transformations. This ensures complete coverage.
